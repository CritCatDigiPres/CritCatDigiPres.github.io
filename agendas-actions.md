# Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions: prioritising agendas and actions

## 4 February 2022 (online, UK GMT friendly)

## 11 February 2022 (online, [10:00-12:00 EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20220211T1500))

### Overview

The past, present, and future of anglophone cataloguing, including their spatial and temporal resonances, has for the 'Legacies' team provided a focal point for research, technological experimentation, the development of training materials, and partnership development. At our workshops, talks, and discussion forums, we have benefited from the insight, curiosity, and enthusiasm of colleagues across the cultural heritage sector committed to investigating the inequities in legacies catalogue data and to mitigating their harms.

Now, as our current round of funding draws to a close, we invite members of that community to join us to set shared agendas and agree next steps. We will ask where we should focus our collective resources, what things we need to work differently, and the role of computational technologies in both shaping and constraining action. 

Both events will work towards a single co-produced output: an infographic explaining the problem area, our shared priorities, and the next steps for action, the production of which will be supported by [Lucy Havens](https://ljhavens.myportfolio.com/).

### Booking

#### UK-based event

Numbers will be capped at roughly 15 attendees. To book your free place, please write to [James](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/humanities/about/staff/jwb1n21.page) - at j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk - including a brief statement on your interest in the theme of the day.

#### US-timezone event

This event will narrow our focus in two ways. First, to free-text descriptions of visual collections, a domain where archaic, offensive, and harmful language and language structures that perpetuate inequality are commonly found. Second, to reparative cataloguing, and in particular the implications of reparative work in a domain where the style of landmark catalogues or cataloguers continues to resonate for many years after their work was completed or published. Third, to make connections between the actions we take now and the machine-driven futures we facilitate.

Numbers will be capped at roughly 15 invited attendees. To book your free place, please write to [Cindy](https://walpole.library.yale.edu/people/cynthia-roman) and [James](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/humanities/about/staff/jwb1n21.page) - cynthia.roman@yale.edu & j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk - including a brief statement on your interest in the theme of the day.
