Greetings to all digital preservation enthusiasts!

We're thrilled to announce our upcoming event, “Preserving our Digital Pasts: Stories, Methods, Futures,” scheduled for June 13, 2024, at the beautiful [Avenue Campus at the University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/student-life/campuses/avenue). We look forward to welcoming professionals involved in digital preservation, cultural heritage, and related fields.

**What to Expect**: Our event aims to bring together experts and practitioners to share insights and experiences in preserving digital artifacts. The day will be packed with informative talks, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on rapid training sessions. These activities are designed to not only educate but also to inspire and provoke thoughtful discussion on the future of digital preservation.
We are particularly excited to unveil our new digital preservation assistant tool, which we believe has the potential to support a range of needs in the digital preservation community.

**Event Highlights**:

- **Educational Talks**: Learn from experts sharing their in-depth knowledge and real-world experiences.
- **Panel Discussions**: Engage with fellow professionals in interactive sessions.
- **Rapid Training**: Participate in quick training sessions that are sure to enhance your skills and knowledge.
