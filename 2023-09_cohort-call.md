## Call for Participants

The University of Southampton is seeking up to 10 individuals from UK-based galleries, libraries, archives and museums, community heritage groups, or other related organisations who have digital preservation training, support, and advice needs to participate in the 11-month project '[Critical Cataloguing for Digital Preservation](https://critcatdigipres.github.io/)', funded by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK)](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/opportunity-arts-and-humanities-led-research-commercialisation/).

'Critical Cataloguing for Digital Preservation' aims to develop a commercial model for digital preservation training, support, and advice that foregrounds the importance of critical cataloguing practices within the digital preservation lifecycle.

Working with the project team, participants will explore their particular preservation needs, have access to advisory support in navigating digital preservation best practice, and join a final project workshop that shapes the trajectory of the Southampton Digital Preservation Advisory Unit, a new enterprise project hosted and supported by Southampton Digital Humanities.

Expressions of interest should be sent to James Baker by email at [j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk](mailto:j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk) and include the following information:

- Your Name(s)
- Your Organisation
- A statement (roughly 200-400 words in length) describing your digital preservation needs.

The deadline for expressions of interest is Friday 10 November. For an informal discussion, please contact Professor James Baker by email at [j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk](mailto:j.w.baker@soton.ac.uk).
